What is the developed project?
Â 
The proposed work consists of an incentive model based on a collaborative information economy. What is sought to be solved is the lack of connection that exists between the different databases of health service providers in Chile. The main problem is that these entities can not share the information they have about their patients without their consent.
To solve this problem, a web solution is proposed in which the health provider can request the patient's information from his medical record stored in the systems of another health provider. The patient has the ability to authorize this request using an identity control tool. Once this authorization is validated, the application manages the sending of the cards in HL7 format, which is the most widely used standard for health information management.
Upon receiving this information in the platform, the identifiers of the patients are encrypted and statistical methods are applied, generating information of interest in a database.
Finally, the medical file in the original format is sent to the provider that requires it to make a better diagnosis. As a method of sustainability of the model, it is proposed to deliver digital currencies that can then be exchanged by both patients and providers. Providers can request anonymous information to generate better policies, and patients can use them to exchange them with service providers in our network.
The RCE-Net platform is the administrator of this service, which generates value for both patients and service providers.

How can blockchain integration help people or industries in this process?

The providers of health services know that the data have a high value in the information age, as soon as information is extracted from these data, they can prevent and make decisions regarding health policies. However, keeping this information secure (available, complete and confidential) is not an easy task, so incentives are needed for providers to invest resources in administering it adequately and sharing it. In addition, something that is not internalized in society, is that the owners of that information are the patients, the process of obtaining it is tedious and its difficulty scales with the number of providers where the patients have been treated. Finally, to deliver the information, health providers need to verify that the person requesting the information is in fact the patient, otherwise he risks heavy fines.
Through the use of Blockchain, mainly 2 problems are solved; You can digitally verify the identity of the person requesting your information, and also leave a public and incorruptible record that both are in accordance with the use policies that RCE-Net proposes. Through these policies, both providers and patients benefit from the shared information system, with a more agile distribution of information in the national health system.

How is the problem of the safety of people in this information transfer addressed?

When the patient goes to a health provider, it is he / she who can accept or not that said institution receives their information from the rest of the providers, also accepting that the institution that is providing the service stores their information in their records. This institution has an obligation to protect it and not share it if it does not have the consent of the owner of the information.
The focus is on collecting information that is distributed in the health system to generate greater knowledge of the inhabitants of Chile, maintaining the privacy of the information, so that the information delivered will always be anonymous unless the patient authorizes to identify himself.
As mentioned above, there is statistical information that is being collected as the medical records are requested and delivered. This information is properly encrypted, in order to be used in a statistical way and not to identify patients.
